//////// HOW TO COMPILE ME ///////

// To make the cxx and h files for the custom pdf.
root -l -b -q makeBivariateGaus.C

Do these two commands and you will get a .so file and a dictionary. The .so file can be linked when compiling main. That can be done by
  setting the variable _SET_extraLibs to the location of the .so file.
root -l
.x bivariateGaus.cxx+
